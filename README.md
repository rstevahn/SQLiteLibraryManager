# SQLite Library Manager
 A library management app built using Express, Pug, and Sequelize

### Project 8, Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree

Extra Credit features included:
-  I added a search feature. Searches are case insensitive and include partial matches. User may search by:
- - Title
- - Author
- - Genre
- - Year
- I added pagination. I display only 10 results at a time. Home, Prev, Next and End links are provided below the results when appropriate.

Additional features:
- SQL model validation of the year field to limit it to numeric values between 1000 and 2050.
- basic CSS for the navigation elements

This project uses JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.
